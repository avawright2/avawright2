I am currently working on my personal website, https://miguelcamarena.com/, and I am interested in exploring ways to integrate it with GitHub for version control and collaborative development.

Are there any recommended best practices for integrating a personal website with GitHub?

What are some effective strategies for managing website assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) using GitHub repositories?

Are there specific GitHub features or workflows that you find particularly useful for maintaining a personal website?

I appreciate any insights, tips, or recommendations you can provide. Thank you in advance for your time and expertise!
